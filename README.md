# Offline Analysis Engine for Detecting Anti-adblockers

This repo hosts the offline analysis engine for detecting client-side anti-adblockers. It currently only has the Python scripts for processing executioin traces. Chromium patch for generating differential execution traces is alive [here](https://bitbucket.org/smarabbit/adblocker/src/master/).
